# Excel Projects for Data Analytics
A collection of Excel projects focused on data analytics — including data cleaning, visualization, KPI tracking, and automation using formulas, PivotTables, Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX.  
## 1) 🛠️ Data Science Top Skills Analysis Project:
An interactive Excel dashboard showing the top data skills, job roles, and their salaries via multiple worksheets.
Quickly compare which skills pay best, see what employers seek, and filter by **job title** or **country**.  

Great for exploring data job market trends, skills, and salaries.

1️⃣ **(Skills Likelihood)-->** Workdsheet shows a comparsion of the top skills required based on the job title and the country:

➡️ All these worksheets were built using **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **DAX** for data modeling, transformation, and analysis:

 🟢 Power Query → Used to import, clean, and transform data before loading it into the worksheet.
